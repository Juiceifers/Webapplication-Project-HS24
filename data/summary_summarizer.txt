 The tutorial is going to take place more or less every other week. We thought about the dates and tried to distribute the tutorials in a way that is most convenient for you Check OLA T (course schedule or calendar) to be sure! Exercises work in pairs of two (mandatory) - Please state both names in the filename (pdf) olatname1_olatname2_icl2_exercise0X.pdf - Only one person submits the exercise on OLA T.

 Outline Databases are great, but for C L, they are often not sufficient because of language complexity. You are going to come across some of the problems language poses as well as possible solutions. Questiooooooooon!! We need to use the language language to solve the problems we find in the search for the Nobel Prize in Food Waste Reduction and the Nobel Peace Prize for reducing food waste to less than 1% of the total prize amount. We also need to find a solution to the language complexity of the search engine.
